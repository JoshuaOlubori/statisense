## 📌 Executive Summary

### The "K-Shaped" Economic Divergence

According to Investopedia.com, a K-shaped recovery "occurs when, following a recession, different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes."

The Nigerian economy exhibits a stark divergence: while the financial and digital economies are expanding, the real sector—manufacturing and consumer goods—is contracting. This is driven by three primary shocks: aggressive currency devaluation, the removal of the petrol subsidy, and persistent security challenges in the agricultural belt.

### Key Highlights

* **Financial Sector Boom:** Recorded a **29.6% YoY growth in 2024**. High-interest rates and FX revaluation gains have decoupled this sector from the broader struggle.
* **Cost of Living Crisis:** Inflation is chronic; **Imported Food inflation reached 41.3%** in 2024.
* **Corporate Profitability Shift:** While **Zenith Bank** saw profits jump by **153% in 2023**, industrial giants like **MTN Nigeria** and **Nestlé Nigeria** recorded massive losses due to FX-related liabilities.

## 📉 2. CPI & Inflation Analysis

### Inflation Dynamics

The removal of the fuel subsidy (2023) and Naira unification served as massive shocks. The "All Items" index has increased by **381.7%** cumulatively since 2015.

### 🔥 Highest Cost Drivers (2015–2024)

* **General Food:** 
* **Food & Non-Alcoholic Beverages:** 
* **Imported Food:** 
* **Transport:** 

**Figure 3:** *Components experiencing the highest cost-of-living increases over the last 10 years.*

### 🔍 GDP vs. CPI Insights

* **Resilience:** The **ICT sector** remains resilient; digital services are inelastic—consumers maintain data usage despite rising prices.
* **The Squeeze:** **Manufacturing and Trade** are hurting. While their GDP volume might show slight growth, rising logistics and input costs are squeezing margins beyond what consumers can absorb.
* **The Beneficiary:** **Financial Services** often find a hedge in inflation, as rising prices lead to higher interest rates and FX revaluation gains for Tier-1 banks.

## 🏢 3. Company–Sector Analysis: A Tale of Two Economies

The relationship between a sector’s GDP (output volume) and a company’s Profit After Tax (PAT) has diverged significantly.

| Company | Respective Sector | Sector Trend (2024) | Company PAT Growth | Relationship Insight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Zenith Bank** | Financial & Insurance | +29.6% (Boom) | +57% | **Aligned:** High interest rates and FX gains boost both sector and PAT. |
| **Seplat Energy** | Mfg - Oil & Gas | +4.8% (Recovery) | +16.9% | **Resilient:** Dollarized revenues provide a natural hedge. |
| **MTN Nigeria** | ICT | +5.4% (Growth) | -192% (Loss) | **Diverged:** Volume is up, but USD-denominated debt destroyed PAT. |
| **Nestlé Niger** | Manufacturing | +8.6% (Growth) | -164.6bn (Loss) | **Distressed:** Unable to pass high input costs to weakened consumers. |
| **Okomu Oil** | Agriculture | +2.1% (Steady) | Growth | **Resilient:** Export-linked commodity pricing protects margins. |

## 🧭 4. Recommendations

### 🏛️ For the Nigerian Economic Advisory Team

1. **FX Intervention for Essential Industry:** Implement a **"Managed Floating Window"**—a dedicated, prioritized exchange rate channel for essential industrial inputs. This prevents the value erosion seen in Nestlé and MTN.
2. **Agriculture Productivity:** Shift from basic farming to **"Agro-Processing."** Invest in secure transport corridors and solar-powered cold storage to reduce post-harvest losses and curb food inflation.
3. **Taxing the Windfall:** Consider a temporary **"Windfall Tax"** on banking revaluation gains to fund infrastructure in struggling real-sector industries.

### 💼 For Investors

* **Overweight: Financial Services (Tier-1 Banks).** Specifically **Zenith Bank**; they are the most efficient hedge against Naira volatility and high-interest environments.
* **Overweight: Upstream Energy.** **Seplat Energy** allows investors to play the Nigerian economy with "Hard Currency Protection" due to dollarized revenues.
* **Avoid: Highly Leveraged Consumer Goods.** Until the exchange rate stabilizes, these firms will face "accounting losses" from FX liabilities that prevent dividend payouts.
