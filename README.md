## 📌 Executive Summary

### The "K-Shaped" Economic Divergence

This report provides a multi-dimensional analysis of Nigeria’s economic trajectory over the last decade (2015–2024). The data reveals a phenomenon of **"K-shaped" divergence**: while the financial and digital economies are reaching record heights, the real sector—manufacturing, telecommunications, and consumer goods—is undergoing a structural contraction. This split is primarily driven by three external and internal shocks: aggressive currency devaluation, the removal of the petrol subsidy, and persistent security challenges in the agricultural belt.

### Key Highlights

- **Financial Sector Boom:** The Financial & Insurance sector has decoupled from the broader economy, recording a **29.6% YoY growth in 2024**. This is largely a result of high-interest-rate environments and foreign exchange (FX) revaluation gains.
- **Cost of Living Crisis:** Inflation has transitioned from a chronic issue to an acute emergency. In 2024, **Imported Food inflation reached 41.3%**, signaling a near-total pass-through of exchange rate volatility into the average Nigerian’s diet.
- **Corporate Profitability Shift:** A massive redistribution of value is underway. While **Zenith Bank** saw profits jump by **153% in 2023**, industrial giants like **MTN Nigeria** and **Nestlé Nigeria** recorded historical losses, with MTN’s losses widening by **192% in 2024** due to massive FX-related liabilities.

### Core Insight

Nigeria is no longer a "rising tide that lifts all boats." Policy intervention must shift from headline GDP targeting to **sector-specific stabilization**, particularly focusing on the FX-exposed manufacturing and telecommunications sectors which are the country's primary non-oil employers.

## 📊 1. GDP Analysis: The Shift from Oil to Services

### Overview

The Nigerian economy has undergone a slow but definitive structural shift. For decades, Oil & Gas was the heartbeat of the nation, but the period between 2015 and 2024 shows a sector in terminal struggle, with a **CAGR of -4.4%**. In contrast, the Services sector—led by Finance and ICT—has stepped in to fill the vacuum, though it does not yet provide the same level of foreign exchange liquidity as the oil sector once did.

### 🚀 Top 5 Sectors by Growth (2024)

1. **Financial & Insurance (29.6%):** This sector's growth is "pro-cyclical" to the current crisis. Higher Central Bank policy rates and the revaluation of dollar assets have created a windfall for Tier-1 banks.
2. **Water Supply & Waste Management (8.4%):** A surprising outlier, indicating increased urbanization and gradual privatization of utility services.
3. **Transportation & Storage (6.5%):** A recovery phase following the logistics shocks of 2022-2023, though still hampered by high fuel costs.
4. **Information & Communication (5.4%):** Despite corporate losses in the sector, the _volume_ of digital activity (data usage) continues to grow, making it a "necessity" in the modern Nigerian economy.
5. **Manufacturing - Oil & Gas (4.8%):** A mild recovery in refining and midstream activities, offering a glimmer of hope for domestic energy security.

**Figure 1:** Top 5 sectors by growth rate in 2024, demonstrating the divergence between financial services (+29.6%), utility infrastructure (+8.4%), and real-sector recovery (+4.8% to +6.5%). Finance and ICT continue to outpace traditional sectors, reinforcing the K-shaped economic pattern.

### 🧱 Top Contributors to GDP (2024)

- **Agriculture (24.6%):** Remains the largest contributor but suffers from "low-value" output. It is the nation's safety net but lacks the productivity to drive industrialization.
- **ICT (17.7%):** Has cemented its position as the "new oil," contributing nearly a fifth of the GDP.

**Figure 2:** Sectoral GDP growth trends (2015–2024) illustrating the structural decline in Oil & Gas (CAGR: -4.4%), the resilience of Agriculture (24.6% of total GDP), and the emergence of Finance and ICT as growth drivers. The divergence between oil and services accelerated post-2022 following fuel subsidy removal and currency devaluation.

## 📉 2. CPI & Inflation: The Food Security Emergency

### Inflation Dynamics

Nigeria's inflation is no longer just a monetary phenomenon; it is a cost-push crisis. The removal of the fuel subsidy in 2023 and the subsequent unification of the Naira exchange rate acted as a dual shock to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

### 🔥 Highest Cost Drivers (2024)

- **Imported Food (+41.3%):** Because Nigeria remains heavily dependent on imported wheat, sugar, and specialty fats, the devaluation of the Naira has directly translated into "imported hunger."
- **General Food (+39.8%):** Driven by domestic logistics costs (diesel) and the displacement of farmers in the North-Central "food belt."
- **Transport (+31.7%):** The permanent reset of fuel prices has increased the "last-mile" cost of every good sold in the country.

### ⏳ Cumulative Impact (2015–2024)

The data suggests that food prices have effectively quintupled (500% increase) over the decade. This has led to a **"hollowing out" of the middle class**, where discretionary spending on **Entertainment**, **Real Estate**, and **Non-essential Services** has collapsed as households reallocate nearly 60-70% of income to food.

**Figure 3:** Year-over-year inflation rates by CPI component in 2024, highlighting the sharp increases in Imported Food (+41.3%), General Food (+39.8%), and Transport (+31.7%). These cost drivers reflect the cascading effects of Naira devaluation and fuel subsidy removal on consumer prices.

## 🏢 3. Company–Sector Analysis: A Tale of Two Economies

The alignment between sector GDP and company profitability has broken down. While a sector may show "growth" in GDP terms (which measures output volume), companies within that sector may be dying due to "value erosion."

| Company           | Sector        | Sector Trend (2024) | Company Trend (PAT 2024) | Insight                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zenith Bank**   | Financials    | +29.6% (Boom)       | +57% Profit              | **Winner:** Beneficiary of high rates & FX revaluation.          |
| **Seplat Energy** | Oil & Gas     | +4.8% (Recovery)    | +16.9% Profit            | **Resilient:** Dollarized revenues provide a natural hedge.      |
| **MTN Nigeria**   | ICT           | +5.4% (Growth)      | -192% Loss               | **FX Hostage:** High volume growth but wiped out by USD debt.    |
| **Nestlé Niger**  | Manufacturing | +8.6% (Growth)      | -164.6bn (Loss)          | **Distressed:** Unable to pass all costs to a weakened consumer. |

| **Figure 4a:** Company PAT performance in 2024 showing the stark divergence between financial sector winners (Zenith Bank +57%) and real-sector losers (MTN -192%, Nestlé -164.6bn), despite positive sector GDP growth. | **Figure 4b:** 10-year profitability trajectories comparing Zenith Bank's steady ascent with MTN Nigeria's sharp decline post-2022, illustrating how FX exposure and interest rate environments create winners and losers within growing sectors. |


### 🧠 Key Insight

The divergence shows that **volume does not equal value**. People are using more data (MTN) and buying more seasoning cubes (Nestlé), but the companies cannot convert this activity into profit because their cost of capital and inputs (denominated in USD) has outpaced the local purchasing power.

## 🧭 4. Recommendations

### 🏛️ For the Nigerian Economic Advisory Team

1. **Prioritize "Food Sovereignty":** Move beyond "loans for farmers." Focus on **secure transport corridors** and solar-powered cold storage to reduce the 40% post-harvest loss that keeps domestic food inflation high.
2. **FX Intervention for Essential Industry:** Introduce a "Managed Floating Window" specifically for critical manufacturing inputs to prevent the total exit of multinational producers.
3. **Taxing the Windfall:** Consider a temporary "Windfall Tax" on banking revaluation gains to fund critical infrastructure, ensuring the financial boom supports the real sector recovery.

### 💼 For Investors

- **Overweight: Tier-1 Banks.** They remain the most efficient hedge against Naira volatility and high-inflation environments.
- **Overweight: Upstream Energy.** Companies like **Seplat** represent a way to play the Nigerian economy with "hard currency" protection.
- **Avoid: Highly Leveraged Consumer Goods.** Until the exchange rate stabilizes, these firms will continue to report "accounting losses" that prevent dividend payouts.
